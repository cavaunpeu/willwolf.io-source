Hi! My name's Will. I'm equal parts: **technologist, bookworm, polyglot, cyclist, optimist, traveler**.

**Broadly, my story is as follows:**

- `[2005-2010]` I was a **semi-professional internet poker player.** From age 15-20, I methodically built $50 into $150,000 through hard work and the help of terrific peers. In addition, I coached players from around the world via Skype.
- `[2007-2011]` I studied **industrial engineering and mathematics** at Penn State University as a member of the Schreyer Honors College.
- `[2012-2014]` I completed a **26.5-month solo backpacking and cycling [trip](http://www.willtravellife.com) around the world**, visiting over 40 countries on 5 continents. As highlights, I: traveled overland from Sweden to Côte D’Ivoire; taught university Spanish and middle school Physics (in French) in Guinea-Conakry; rode a [bicycle](http://willtravellife.com/category/will-bikes-central-asia/) 7,600 kilometers from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan through the Caucasus and Central Asian “Stans."
- `[2014-2016]` I worked at [LiveAuctioneers](https://www.liveauctioneers.com) and [ShopKeep](https://www.shopkeep.com) in **data science roles.**
- `[2016-2017]` I quit my job and moved to Casablanca, Morocco to pursue an **Open-Source ["Master's"]({filename}/life/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco.md) in machine learning and statistics**—a full-time, self-curated schedule of textbooks, MOOCs, publishing code to my [GitHub](https://github.com/cavaunpeu) and writing to this blog.
- `[2017-2021]` I [joined ASAPP]({filename}/life/joining-asapp.md) as a machine learning engineer, then researcher, then machine learning engineer. My work spanned **pure NLP research, applied NLP research, engineering and product.**
- `[2021-2022]` I [left ASAPP]({filename}/life/leaving-asapp.md). I'm taking some time to [explore]({filename}/life/exploring-crypto.md).
- `[2022-2023]` I joined [Block Science](https://block.science/) as a Visiting Research Engineer working on the **design, simulation, and analysis of cryptoeconomic systems.** In addition, I joined [Cred Protocol](https://www.credprotocol.com/) as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer, building **credit scoring models for DeFi.**
- `[2023-Present]` I work as a Senior Simulation Engineer at [Gauntlet](https://gauntlet.network/), building DeFi risk management tools and products with the best in the game.

**Presently, I spend my time on:**

- `Crypto` Intersections of machine learning, complex systems, and crypto.

- `Language` I love learning and speaking foreign languages. I'm a longtime speaker of **[Spanish](http://willwolf.io/es/)** and **French**. At present, I'm voraciously learning **Russian**.

- `Reading` I read a lot of books. [Here's]({filename}/pages/books.md) a few from recent years.
