My name's Will. I'm equal parts: **technologist, bookworm, polyglot, cyclist, optimist, traveler**.

*Broadly, my story is as follows:*

- `[2005-2010]:` I was a **semi-professional internet poker player.** From age 15-20, I methodically built $50 into ~$150,000 through hard work and the help of terrific peers. In addition, I coached players from around the world on Skype.
- `[2007-2011]:` I studied **industrial engineering and mathematics** at Penn State University.
- `[2012-2014]:` I completed a **26.5-month solo backpacking and cycling [trip](http://www.willtravellife.com) around the world**, visiting 40+ countries on 5 continents. I traveled overland from Sweden to Côte D’Ivoire, taught university Spanish and middle school Physics (in French) in Guinea-Conakry, and rode my [bicycle](http://willtravellife.com/category/will-bikes-central-asia/) 7,600 kilometers from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan through the Caucasus and Central Asian “Stans" to name a few of my proudest achievements.
- `[2014-2016]:` I began **teaching myself topics in machine learning** and software engineering. Thereafter, I worked in data science roles at [LiveAuctioneers](https://www.liveauctioneers.com) and [ShopKeep](https://www.shopkeep.com).
- `[2016-2017]:` I quit my job and **moved to Casablanca, Morocco to pursue an open-source ["masters"]({filename}/articles/practical-guide-open-source-ml-masters.md)** in machine learning and statistics—a full-time, self-curated schedule of textbooks, MOOCs, publishing code to my [GitHub](https://github.com/cavaunpeu) and writing to this blog.
- `[2017-]:` I [joined ASAPP]({filename}/articles/joining-asapp.md) as a **machine learning engineer, now researcher.**

*Presently, I spend my time as follows:*

### Research

I currently work for [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/) as a machine learning researcher. Broadly, I focus on problems in [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). (Specifically, on inducing procedural structure in task-oriented dialog.)

### Language

I love learning and speaking foreign languages. I'm a longtime speaker of [Spanish](http://willwolf.io/es/) and French. At present, I'm learning Russian, on which I spend a significant amount of time.

### Geopolitics

Lately, I'm [writing](http://willwolf.io/geopolitics/) at the intersection of artificial intelligence and geopolitics. Specifically, I'm exploring the impact that the former—the subject of my expertise—will have on trade, policy, power, cooperation, defense.

### Reading

I read a lot of books. Here's a [few](http://willwolf.io/books/) from recent years.

*What's next:*

### In one year

I aim to be a better researcher and Russian speaker.

### In ten years

I aim to be an advisor, leader and cross-functional decision maker: advising governments, informing policy, mentoring others, and building something special.
