Hi! My name's Will. I'm equal parts: **technologist, bookworm, polyglot, cyclist, optimist, traveler**.

**Broadly, my story is as follows:**

- `[2005-2010]` I was a **semi-professional internet poker player.** From age 15-20, I methodically built $50 into $150,000 through hard work and the help of terrific peers. In addition, I coached players from around the world via Skype.
- `[2007-2011]` I studied **industrial engineering and mathematics** at Penn State University as a member of the Schreyer Honors College.
- `[2012-2014]` I completed a **26.5-month solo backpacking and cycling [trip](http://www.willtravellife.com) around the world**, visiting over 40 countries on 5 continents. As highlights, I: traveled overland from Sweden to Côte D’Ivoire; taught university Spanish and middle school Physics (in French) in Guinea-Conakry; rode a [bicycle](http://willtravellife.com/category/will-bikes-central-asia/) 7,600 kilometers from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan through the Caucasus and Central Asian “Stans."
- `[2014-2016]` After **teaching myself topics in machine learning** and software engineering, I worked at [LiveAuctioneers](https://www.liveauctioneers.com) and [ShopKeep](https://www.shopkeep.com) in data science roles.
- `[2016-2017]` I quit my job and **moved to Casablanca, Morocco to pursue an open-source ["masters"]({filename}/life/practical-guide-open-source-ml-masters.md)** in machine learning and statistics—a full-time, self-curated schedule of textbooks, MOOCs, publishing code to my [GitHub](https://github.com/cavaunpeu) and writing to this blog.
- `[2017-present]` I [joined ASAPP]({filename}/life/joining-asapp.md) as a **machine learning engineer, now researcher.**

**Presently, I spend my time on:**

- `Research` I currently work for [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/) as a **machine learning researcher.** Broadly, I focus on problems in [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). (Specifically, on inducing procedural structure in task-oriented dialog.)

- `Language` I love learning and speaking foreign languages. I'm a longtime speaker of **[Spanish](http://willwolf.io/es/)** and **French**. At present, I'm voraciously learning **Russian**.

- `Writing` Lately, I'm [writing](http://willwolf.io/geopolitics/) about **intersections of artificial intelligence and geopolitics.** Specifically, I'm exploring the impact that the former—the subject of my expertise—will have on trade, policy, power, cooperation, defense, etc.

- `Reading` I read a lot of books. [Here's](http://willwolf.io/books/) a few from recent years.

**Moving forward, I aim to be:**

- `In one year` A **better researcher and Russian speaker.**

- `In ten years` An **advisor, leader and cross-functional decision maker**: advising governments, informing policy, mentoring others, and building something special.
