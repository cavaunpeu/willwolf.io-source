My name is Will Wolf, a technologist from Philadelphia. I currently live in Casablanca, Morocco where I'm pursuing an open-source ["masters"]({filename}/articles/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco.md) in machine learning. Just before, I worked as a Data Scientist at [ShopKeep](https://www.shopkeep.com) in New York City, and mentored students in Data Science and Python for [Thinkful](http://thinkful.com/). I'm passionate about mathematics, cycling, language and travel.

I studied Industrial Engineering and Mathematics at Penn State University. There, I played ice hockey, enjoyed math classes more than most, and spent two years writing an Honors [thesis](https://honors-prod.sas.psu.edu/catalog/1947) on game theory and group dynamics with Dr. Eli Byrne. I graduated in December 2011.

As a teenager, I was what I call a semi-professional internet poker player: I deposited $50 onto Full Tilt Poker at age 15, and spent the following years building this sum into roughly $150,000. For me, poker was an academic and intellectually fascinating endeavor. More than anything, it was a job. I typically played 4-8 tables simultaneously. In addition to playing, I coached several players from around the world through virtual platforms.

After completing my studies, I began what became a 26.5-month solo backpacking and cycling [trip around the world](http://www.willtravellife.com), visiting roughly 40 countries on 5 continents. I traveled overland from Sweden to Côte D’Ivoire, taught university Spanish and middle school Physics, in French, in Guinea-Conakry, and pedaled a [bicycle](http://willtravellife.com/category/will-bikes-central-asia/) 7,600 kilometers from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan through the Caucasus and Central Asian “Stans,” to name a few of my proudest achievements.

Upon return, I quickly fell in love with data science and machine learning; I moved to NYC and purposed my time accordingly. Soon after, I began working at [LiveAuctioneers](https://www.liveauctioneers.com) - a company building an online platform through which online bidders can participate in live auctions - where I built an internally-facing machine learning service to categorize auction items. I then joined ShopKeep, where I worked on a wide variety of machine learning and data infrastructure problems to empower small businesses. Part-time, I mentor Data Science and Python for Thinkful, and recently finished some consulting work for [Data-Pop Alliance](http://www.datapopalliance.org).

As a technologist, I work frequently with the following tools: the Python scientific and inferential stack, Amazon Web Services, SQL, git, Flask, and a heavy handful of machine learning and statistical techniques. I work periodically with many more: Scala, Apache Spark, React and R to name a few. I believe it crucial to be able to both build models and production-ize one's own solutions.

As a human, I carry a deep passion for cycling and language. I speak fluent [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqO0KW3O9uU) and am boyishly passionate about all things Latin America. I speak ~fluent French from time spent in Morocco and West Africa. Cycling - in New York City or through Central Asian deserts alike - makes me smile from ear to ear.

Travel is a big part of who I am. I've been to over 60 countries and believe strongly in the concrete, extraordinary value of traveling abroad. In addition, I'm active in the global [CouchSurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) community as a guest, host, and event participant. My profile can be found [here](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/willw9).

While I'm not sure where I plan to go with machine learning, I do not plan to stop. Ultimately, I'd like to improve lives, predict world events, and inform human-scale problems that actually matter.
