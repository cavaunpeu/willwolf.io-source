As time permits, I am available for consulting and advisory work in the following areas:

# Machine learning

My professional background is primarily in machine learning. Most recently, I spent 4+ years at [ASAPP]({filename}/life/leaving-asapp.md) where I built NLP systems for customer service automation and augmentation. Specifically, I built production systems for intent classification, personalized text recommendation and conversation summarization. In addition, I researched and developed methods for dialog generation, dialog segmentation, "procedure induction" in goal-oriented dialog and online learning. For most of this time, I was directly supervised by [Dr. Kilian Q. Weinberger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8RVWMycAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Examples of our work can be found e.g. [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9TTupqIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=9TTupqIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC). Throughout this time, I worked with an (extremely) wide range of NLP tools and techniques, including the two you likely care most about in 2023, PyTorch and LLMs. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about our [future]({filename}/machine-learning/future-with-llms.md) with the latter.

In addition, I've maintained a keen interest in "statistical" machine learning throughout the years, [writing]({filename}/machine-learning) on topics like approximate inference, Bayesian methods, generative models, PPLs, and many more. I even applied for PhD programs in this space in 2021, wherein I hoped to [bring]({static}/images/nlp_for_sbi_proposal.pdf) techniques from NLP to [simulation-based inference]({filename}/machine-learning/neural-sbi.md).

**Taken together, I'd be a good person to hire for:**

- Applied research: researching and prototyping novel ML-based products.
- Software engineering: building production ML systems.
- Advisory: ML product development, infrastructure and tooling, data collection and labeling, team structure and hiring, etc.

# Multi-agent systems

After ASAPP, I took time to [explore]({filename}/life/exploring-crypto.md) topics in complex systems and simulation in the context of crypto. In that time, I spent a ~year working at [Block Science](https://block.science/) where I built dynamical pricing models for a peer-to-peer compute network, as well as simulations of the rewards economy implicit in a "we pay you for your stock picks" hedge fund. In addition, I worked on a variety of personal [projects]({filename}/crypto/crypto-projects.md) in this space. Currently, I work on the Core Risk team at [Gauntlet](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/) where I build algorithms and systems for statistical risk management in DeFi.

**Taken together, I'd be a good person to hire for:**

- Applied research: researching and prototyping models of multi-agent systems.
- Software engineering: building production simulation systems.
- Advisory: simulation product development, infrastructure and tooling, team structure and hiring, etc.

# Rust

I've been learning Rust since 2021. I've built a few small projects in the language, including a simple simulation [framework](https://github.com/cavaunpeu/simsim) for generalized dynamical systems. I'd love to do more.

**Taken together, I'd be a good person to hire for:**

- Tooling: Rust-based tooling for ML and simulation. For instance, writing NLP tokenizers in Rust for use in Python, or a Rust-based simulation engine.
- Software engineering: building production systems in Rust. Though I have 10 years' experience in Python, I'd likely need a bit of supervision here to start.

# Domains of interest

Here are some domains I'd be particularly interested in working in:

- Autonomous digital agents
- Autonomous physical agents, e.g. autonomous vehicles
- Education
- Foreign language learning
- Robotics
- Logistics and transportation
- Defense

This said, I'm open to working in any domain where I can learn something new and interesting amongst fantastic peers.

# Notes

Crucially, this work cannot conflict with my full-time employ at [Gauntlet](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/). For rates and availability, please email me at williamabrwolf [at] gmail [dot] com. Social links can be found below.
