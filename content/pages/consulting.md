As time permits, I am available for consulting and advisory work in the following areas:

# Machine learning

My professional background is primarily in machine learning. Most recently, I spent 4+ years at [ASAPP]({filename}/life/leaving-asapp.md) where I built NLP systems for customer service automation and augmentation. Specifically, I built production systems for intent classification, personalized text recommendation and conversation summarization. In addition, I researched and developed methods for dialog generation, dialog segmentation, "procedure induction" in goal-oriented dialog and online learning. For most of this time, I was directly supervised by [Dr. Kilian Q. Weinberger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8RVWMycAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Examples of our work can be found e.g. [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9TTupqIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=9TTupqIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC). Throughout this time, I worked with an (extremely) wide range of NLP tools and techniques, including the two you likely care most about in 2023, PyTorch and LLMs. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about our [future]({filename}/machine-learning/future-with-llms.md) with the latter.

In addition, I've maintained a keen interest in "statistical" machine learning throughout the years, [writing]({filename}/machine-learning) on topics like variational inference, partition functions, Gaussian processes, PPLs, and many more. I even applied for PhD programs in this space in 2021, wherein I hoped to [bring]({static}/images/nlp_for_sbi_proposal.pdf) techniques from NLP to [simulation-based inference]({filename}/machine-learning/neural-sbi.md).

**Taken together, I'd be a good person to hire for:**

- Applied research: researching and developing novel ML-based products.
- Software engineering: building production ML systems.
- Advisory: ML product development, infrastructure and tooling, data collection and labeling, team structure and hiring, etc.

Crucially, this work cannot conflict with my full-time employ at [Gauntlet](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/).
