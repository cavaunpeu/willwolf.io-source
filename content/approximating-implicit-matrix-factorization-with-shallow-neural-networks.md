The work for this post is contained in the following [Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cavaunpeu/dotify/blob/master/notebooks/neural_implicit_mf.ipynb).

I plan toÂ move this blog to Pelican or Jekyll in the immediate future, at which point I'll embed the notebook into this post itself. (WordPress has been a disaster for integrating MarkDown, LaTeX, inline code, etc.)

Thanks for reading.
