A README is a document describing how to use a piece of software. Done [well](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/README.md), it is structured, succint, and thorough; it allows the user, foreign to the software in question, to begin using this software effectively, quickly.

One of my colleagues recently shared the idea of a README for *yourself*; in other words, *how to work with me.* In the following text, I endeavour to do exactly this, both as an exercise in self-exploration, and a clean communication "interface" in our remote-dominated professional world.

# How I type on Slack

I generally type in all lowercase letters and with punctuation. For example, I might send the following update message:

```
heya. how goes? how was your weekend? what are you working on today?

i'm tweaking our model. i should be done this evening. i'll let you know when finished.
```

I can imagine this style coming across as *cold, aggravated, even passive-aggressive.* Of course, this is *not* my aim. Properly capitalized text is too much effort for too little reward. Punctuation helps me speak declaratively and stay organized. I'm happy as I type! Promise.

# My communication style

I speak directly about non-sensitive manners. I ask questions, plainly, like: "Why did you make that choice? How much time and effort will that cost? What other solutions did you consider?"

Good science is like a personal chef trying to discover the dish you like most: she'll place food on the plate, you'll take a bite, you'll provide feedback, and she'll iterate. This only works if it is clear to all parties what the dish is and what you truly thought. Otherwise, progress is difficult.

In this vein, explicit communication is crucial. Clarifying questions are sexy. Sanity checks are king. A simple, clear, shared understanding of where we are and where we're not is the name of the game.

# When I have energy

I'm a morning person. My most productive coding/technical hours are between 8 am and 12 pm. In the afternoons, I'd ideally spend my time talking to other people, e.g. in 1 on 1's, team meetings, etc.

# How to message me

Don't overthink it. I don't bite!

# What I look like when I'm thinking

When I need to understanding a problem or make a decision on the spot, I often stare off into space for 5-15 seconds. This helps me think clearly (conversely, staring directly at the camera clouds my brain). Please don't take this as rudeness.

Similarly, when I'm engaged in a technical conversation, my brow is often furrowed. I look intense, exacting, prickly. Again, please don't take this the wrong way. I'm focused on clarifying details for myself and others above all else.

# How to teach me

At work, I prize learning from others—math, engineering, leadership, you name it—above most else. If you have something to teach me, please do. You aren't bothering me. You're not "preaching." Your wisdom is welcome. Keep it coming.

# How to learn from me

If you value what I have to say, let me know. Ask me for more. I love to teach what I've learned from others. If you're open to it, I'll keep it coming as well.
