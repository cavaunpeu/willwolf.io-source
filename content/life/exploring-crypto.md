The "explore vs. exploit" tradeoff is a classic decision-making fulcrum. To illustrate, imagine itâ€™s date-night in downtown Manhattan and youâ€™re choosing where to eat.

To *exploit* is to revisit a restaurant that you already love. The food is well-cooked. The servers are attentive. The decor is tasteful. You'll have a great meal and you know it.

To *explore* is to try a new restaurant in pursuit of something better. It's to implicitly concede that while your previous choice is great, it may not be the best overall. The new restaurant may well be worse. However, you'll never find something better unless you try.

# ASAPP

Four and a half years at ASAPP was my career on "exploit." ASAPP is a company solving important problems amongst brilliant colleagues and a terrific office culture that treats their employees exceedingly well. I benefited from this environment each and every day. I kept choosing ASAPP because it unfailingly was, and remains, an excellent place to call my professional home.

I joined ASAPP at age 28. I'm now 32. And I'd like to see what else there is. Where else I can learn, enjoy, create and grow. In simple terms, I'd like to explore.

For the next year, this is what I plan to do.

# What's next

## On the technical front

- Learn **Rust** and smart-contract development in Solana.
- Study the theory and applications of **complex systems**.
- Immerse myself in **crypto** theory, applications and community.
- **Explore the intersection of all three.**

## On the personal front

- Improve my Russian.
- Spend time with friends.
- Travel.

## PhD?

I've applied for Ph.D. programs in statistical ML. Weâ€™ll see if Iâ€™m accepted.

## In sum

In the spirit of exploration, I won't rigidly structure this period of my life. Instead, I'll see where my interests lead and follow them vigorously.
