In July of 2017, on the heels of my Open-Source Machine Learning ["Master's"]({filename}/life/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco.md)—10 months of wide-eyed, high-enery weeks studying machine learning fundamentals—I was ready for a new adventure. Namely, I [wanted to join]({filename}/life/my-next-role.md) "a smaller company with machine learning at the core of its business that, necessarily, has made significant investments in relevant talent, support, and growth." As its 78th employee, i.e. early enough to land the Slack handle @will!, I joined ASAPP.

As a company, ASAPP builds technologies that help human knowledge workers—principally in customer service—be better, faster, and happier at what they do. As a competitor, it gains its edge by hiring machine learning research, engineering and product experts to focus singularly on the customer service domain. As a culture, it works tirelessly to piece these parts together in a way that's intuitive, collaborative, and fun. In fact, lots of fun.

During my 4+ years at ASAPP, I worked on both our machine learning engineering and research teams. I helped develop, plan and build numerous products. I learned an enormous amount about research, natural language processing, tradeoffs and risk as a unit of thought, why simple solutions work, planning, working across an organization, giving presentations, critiquing the work of others, intellectual humility, how to build a team, building products, software engineering, company culture, and much, much more.

But this is, at most, an aside. Instead, let's talk about what always matters most: the people.

Sincerely, it is difficult to overstate the passion, creativity, and kindness of my past and present colleagues at ASAPP. By passion, I mean the time we spent studying machine learning—on the weekends, around the whiteboard, or through books—together. By creativity, I mean all of the cool things that we built that we built—together. By kindness, I mean the way we treat each other, our customers, our interviewees, our visitors, and our advisors. Through the warmth and example of these relationships, I've grown immensely as a person, professional and friend. I look forward to further building and cherishing them for years to come.

I'm leaving [ASAPP, Inc.](https://www.asapp.com/) after 4+ wonderful years. I'm incredibly grateful for all that ASAPP has given to me, and I look forward to seeing all that they accomplish in the years to come.

From here, I have some exciting plans, which I aim to share soon!
