Summary: I now work in crypto—building credit scoring models at [Cred Protocol](https://www.credprotocol.com/) and simulations of complex systems at [Block Science](https://block.science/).

I left ASAPP in December 2021 to "explore": Rust, complex systems, crypto. After ~4 months of study, podcasts, conversations, toy [projects]({filename}/crypto/crypto-projects.md), Twitter, meetups, and general experimentation, I've now re-entered the workforce; I now work in crypto.

Per our brave new remote world, and per the breadth of my technical interests, I recently started *two* new jobs in this zany space: building credit scoring models at [Cred Protocol](https://www.credprotocol.com/) and simulations of complex systems at [Block Science](https://block.science/). The former is my primary gig.

# Cred Protocol

Cred aims to enable under-collateralized, capital efficient borrowing of cryptocurrencies by quantifying wallet risk. In other words, much like FICO's 300-850, we're building a credit score. From a technical stance, credit scoring means building tooling and algorithms to quantify risk—of tens of millions of crypto—in near real-time. Per my longstanding interests in building systems, probabilistic modeling, and building statistical products—meshed with a world of new data, new players, new data structures, new rules—and remixed with my current energy to build great things from the ground up—I jumped at the opportunity to be join Cred as one of its first few hires. We're currently about ~10 people, and growing quickly.

# Block Science

Ten years ago, I wrote an undergraduate thesis about the simulation of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games which has remained of abiding fascination ever since. Last year, I realized that crypto offers a perfect "arena" for the simulation of similar "complex systems": a blockchain gives a graph data structure indexed by time, with copious amounts of structured, *public* data! In other words, thinking about systems built on blockchains as complex systems, simulating their behavior in code, then aligning expected results with empirical results is a highly tractable, useful, and interesting line of work.

Block Science is a leader in doing exactly this—for system both in crypto, and outside of crypto. As a visiting contributor, I build, analyze, and communicate simulations of "cryptoeconomic" systems for a variety of partners. Broadly, Block Science is comprised of ~30 talented and diverse members—with backgrounds spanning economics, social science, natural science, behavioral science, and more—and growing quickly as well.

# Brooklyn

Oh, and for the time being, I've moved to Brooklyn!

If you're nearby, let's hang.
