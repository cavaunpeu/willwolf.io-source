Halford J. Mackinder was an English geographer, academic and politician. Born in the 1860's, and deceased shortly after the end of World War II, he is in large part famous for a reading of a 1904 paper at the Royal Geographical Society entitled *[The Geographical Pivot of History](https://www.iwp.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20131016_MackinderTheGeographicalJournal.pdf)*.
