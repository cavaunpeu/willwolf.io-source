Halford J. Mackinder was an English geographer, academic and politician. Born in the 1860's and deceased shortly after the end of World War II, he is largely famous for a reading at the Royal Geographical Society of his 1904 paper, *[The Geographical Pivot of History](https://www.iwp.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20131016_MackinderTheGeographicalJournal.pdf)*. Therein, Mackinder outlines his famous "Heartland Theory," a geopolitical analysis of the importance of controlling in the 20th century what is modern Central Asia. Though he covers a lot of ground—from climate, to religion, to technology—I will begin by painting a picture with his broadest strokes.

At the start, Mackinder asserts that at the time of his writing, the world stands at the Exit of the Columbian epoch: a 400-year period of European expansionism, in which European states—principally French, Spanish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese—sent their generals, scientists and engineers to explore, detail, and ultimately subjugate people and land in the furthest reaches of the globe, transforming themselves from provincial, land-based powers into global empires, now dominant at sea, and transforming the world from an ill-lit, half-built cabin deep in an unnamed wood to an immaculate Grand Hotel with a different European powerhouse in every single room. As such, in 1904, the continent's powers sat atop a now-familiar world, shoulder-to-shoulder, with nowhere to go but *down.*

With the stage set thus, Mackinder begins his famous opus by inviting us to step back, inhale deeply, and reflect—with a bias towards Continental Europe, no doubt, owing implicitly to its then-dominant stature—on some of history's broadest currents through the lens of geography: what was, what is, and what will be utterly crucial in the 20th century—his coming "Geographical Pivot".

Furthermore, this expansion met little resistance, as local populations were no match for their invaders' superior ships, weapons and on-land transport in the form of horses.

Next, Mackinder zooms out, asking:

1. What might bring down these almighty Europeans powers?
2. Who or what rattled these states in the past?
3. What facet of the modern era is neatly poised to reify this disruption—and more ferociously than ever before?

The continental European landmass comprises an intricate series of mountains, valleys, and peninsulas; in turn, this geography provides ample natural, physical barriers between peoples, in which a multitude of politically and culturally distinct states could take root. Conversely, Mackinder notes that the Russian landmass has an altogether different geographic profile: dense forest to the North, dry, arid, inhospitable steppe to the south, and unendingly flat throughout. Unlike Europe, this geography bred a different type of person and societal organization: regional capitals like Kiev, Moscow and Kazan took root in the former, while the latter gave rise to a thousand years of nomadic invaders—Huns, Avers, Bulgarians, Magyars, Khazars, Patzinaks, Cumans, Kalmuks, Genghis Khan's Mongols, and others—hardened by its brutal conditions, in sync with the land's silent whisper of "keep on moving, life won't survive here."

this is land power!

Following 400 years of global domination, European historians were wont to consider their own stories and influence as superior to the rest. In response, Mackinder implores us to consider the era that *preceded* the Columbian epoch, and the influence had *on Europe* therein.

In effect, the 5th to 16th centuries saw unending progressions of inveterate Asiatic invaders crossing the Russian steppe and *hammering* the European land powers like *"pestle to mortar."* Furthermore, Mackinder posits that these invasions sparked the formation of many of the modern European states themselves! He writes:

> A large part of modern history might be written as a commentary upon the changes directly or indirectly ensuing from these raids. The Angles and Saxons, it is quite possible, were then driven to cross the seas to found England in Britain. The Franks, the Goths, and the Roman provincials were compelled, for the first time, to stand shoulder to shoulder on the battlefield of Chalons, making common cause against the Asiatics, who were unconsciously welding together modern France. Venice was founded from the destruction of Aquileia and Padua; and even the Papacy owed a decisive prestige to the successful mediation of Pope Leo with Attila at Milan. Such was the harvest of results produced by a cloud of ruthless and idealess horsemen sweeping over the unimpeded plain—a blow, as it were, from the great Asiatic hammer striking freely through the vacant space.
