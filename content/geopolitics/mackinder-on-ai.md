Halford J. Mackinder was an English geographer, academic and politician. Born in the 1860's and deceased shortly after the end of World War II, he is largely famous for a reading at the Royal Geographical Society of his 1904 paper, *[The Geographical Pivot of History](https://www.iwp.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20131016_MackinderTheGeographicalJournal.pdf)*. Therein, Mackinder outlines his famous "Heartland Theory," a geopolitical analysis of the importance of controlling in the 20th century what is modern Central Asia. Though he covers a lot of ground—from climate, to religion, to technology—I will begin by painting a picture with his broadest strokes.

At the start, Mackinder asserts that at the time of his writing, the world stands at the Exit of the Columbian epoch: a 400-year period of European expansionism, in which European states—principally French, Spanish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese—sent their generals, scientists and engineers to explore, detail, and ultimately subjugate people and land in the furthest reaches of the globe, transforming themselves from provincial, land-based powers into global empires, now dominant at sea, and transforming the world from an ill-lit, half-built cabin deep in an unnamed wood to an immaculate Grand Hotel with a different European powerhouse in every single room. As such, in 1904, the continent's powers sat atop a now-familiar world, shoulder-to-shoulder, with nowhere to go but *down.*

With the stage set thus, Mackinder begins his famous opus by inviting us to step back, inhale deeply, and reflect—with a bias towards Continental Europe, no doubt, owing implicitly to its then-dominant stature—on some of history's broadest currents through the lens of geography: what was, what is, and what will be utterly crucial in the 20th century—his coming "Geographical Pivot".

The Continental European landmass comprises an intricate series of mountains, valleys, and peninsulas. These features, in turn, provide Europeans with ample physical barriers between which a multitude of politically and culturally distinct nation-states could and did take root. In stark contrast, Mackinder describes the Russian landmass, of an altogether different geographic profile: dense mixed and deciduous forest to the North; dry, arid, steppe to the South, relatively inhospitable to both life and agriculture; unendingly flat throughout. Unlike Europe, this geography bred a different type of person and society: regional capitals like Kiev, Moscow and Kazan took root just north of this dividing forest-steppe frontier, whereas the sandy steppe itself spawned, well, a thousand years of nomadic invaders—Huns, Avers, Bulgarians, Magyars, Khazars, Patzinaks, Cumans, Kalmuks, Genghis Khan's Mongol hordes, and others—hardened by its brutal conditions, in sync with the land's silent whisper of "keep on moving, life won't survive here."

In its first 1,500 years following the death of Jesus Christ, Continental Europe evolved largely on land. Corralled from the West by the Atlantic, as yet uncrossed, the North by the Scandinavian tundra, the South by, in effect, the immense sweep of the Sahara, and the East by roughly 7,500 kilometers of remaining Eurasia comprised primarily of hostile Central Asian steppe, separating Berlin from Beijing and the Pacific Ocean. As such, the bulk of Europe's military and political growth remained on its home turf. And implicitly, as the only game in town, *land power* reigned supreme.

On the heels of the Renaissance around 1,500 A.D., things changed. Emboldened and energized by newfound knowledge and philosophy at home, European explorers took to the seas in search of more abroad. In 1498, Vasco de Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, traveling directly from Europe to India without traversing the Middle East. In 1492, Columbus, the namesake of the Columbian age itself, crossed the Atlantic and reached the Americas. Over the next 400 years, European nation-states swiftly amassed empires of global proportions, subjugating previous inhabitants under their economic, military, and political control, and becoming, new in history, the preeminent titans of *sea power* throughout.

The following map shows European exploration routes during the this era. (Though it only covers years 1492-1682, the general that trend it shows continues until Mackinder's writing.)

Simply, Europeans went everywhere! Except the Russian Empire. Except Mongolia. Except the Central Asian steppe.

In 1904, following 400 years of global domination, European historians were wont to consider their own stories and influence as superior to the rest. In response, in his paper, Mackinder implores us to reconsider the map of pre-Columbian Continental Europe, and the ways in which, owing to this map, the development of Europe was considerably shaped from the *outside* in.

Indeed, until Columbus, the Atlantic Ocean remained uncrossed, thereby serving as an impregnable natural border to the west. Like, the menacing infinity of the Sahara to the south remained uncrossed until the mid-19th century. Conversely, the cold and cheerless tundra to the north—while effectively moot as a border itself, separating Continental Europe from the uninhabited Arctic—played host to the [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age), a 200-year period of disruption and settlement in and around the North Sea—the British Isles, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and others—as well as a descent down the Dnieper and Volga, living and trading with peoples in Kievan Rus and the Eastern Roman Empire.

Finally, east of the Carpathians (in present day Romania), sweeping north-east to the Ural Mountains, then south-east through both Kazakhstan and Mongolia, is, well, what? What protected, and will henceforth protect, Europe from its eastern neighbors? On what natural borders can it count? Here, Mackinder (figuratively) smiles, stands up, cooly eyes the crowd, and concludes: "Nothing." Then, he reminds European historians what actually happened before the recent Columbian epoch that has so warped their perception and egos.

In reality, the 5th to 16th centuries saw unending progressions of inveterate Asiatic invaders crossing the ceaseless Central Asian steppe and *hammering* the European land powers like *"pestle to mortar."* Furthermore, there is evidence that these invasions sparked the formation of many of the modern Continental European states themselves! Mackinder writes:

> A large part of modern history might be written as a commentary upon the changes directly or indirectly ensuing from these raids. The Angles and Saxons, it is quite possible, were then driven to cross the seas to found England in Britain. The Franks, the Goths, and the Roman provincials were compelled, for the first time, to stand shoulder to shoulder on the battlefield of Chalons, making common cause against the Asiatics, who were unconsciously welding together modern France. Venice was founded from the destruction of Aquileia and Padua; and even the Papacy owed a decisive prestige to the successful mediation of Pope Leo with [Attila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila) at Milan. Such was the harvest of results produced by a cloud of ruthless and idealess horsemen sweeping over the unimpeded plain—a blow, as it were, from the great Asiatic hammer striking freely through the vacant space.

In other words, though Europe society had matured significantly in the preceding 2,000 years, evolving from land-based principalities to sea-faring, nation-state empires of global scale, its *geography* had, and will always, stay the same. In 1904, transcontinental dominion notwithstanding, the steppe to Europe's east lay flat, barren, uninterrupted—*and un-mastered by Europe* as ever.

![european colonial possessions 1900](https://apworldunit5.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/7/6/76761401/701214.gif?880)

(N.B. By 1900, the majority of Latin American states, their own colonial history predominantly that of Spanish and Portuguese imperialism, had already gained independence.)

And finally, in 1904, why was this so significant? Among his esteemed and learned colleagues at the Royal Geographical Society, representing in turn the titans of contemporary global order whose colonial possessions spanned the majority of the planet, why was Mackinder so acutely preoccupied with the final "piece of the puzzle"—the "Heartland"—so influential in Europe's pre-Columbian history?

As a barren steppe, the Heartland lacks the stone and timber necessary for road-making. As such, throughout the majority of history, it was best traversed in the same fashion as that of the Asiatic invaders: on horse and camel. However, in 1904, a recent technology was set to radically alter this fact, to substantially accelerate the pace with which the steppe could be crossed, to transform the perennial Steppe Invasion, abetted by unchanging geography, from a dainty pestle into an industrial-strength pneumatic drill. This technology, [introduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport) in Britain around 1830, was the *railroad*, and the steam-powered trains to which it played host.

| Year | Total Miles of British Railway |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 1830 |                             98 |
| 1835 |                            338 |
| 1840 |                          1,498 |
| 1845 |                          2,441 |
| 1850 |                          6,621 |
| 1855 |                          8,280 |
| 1860 |                         10,433 |

Here, Mackinder concludes, delivering his key insight, as well as the Heartland Theory itself, in one grand sweep:

> A generation ago steam and the Suez canal appeared to have increased the mobility of sea-power relatively to land-power. Railways acted chiefly as feeders to ocean-going commerce. But trans-continental railways are now transmuting the conditions of land-power, and nowhere can they have such effect as in the closed heart-land of Euro-Asia, in vast areas of which neither timber nor accessible stone was available for road-making. Railways work the greater wonders in the steppe, because they directly replace horse and camel mobility, the road stage of development having here been omitted.

> As we consider this rapid review of the broader currents of history, does not a certain persistence of geographical relationship become evident? Is not the pivot region of the world's politics that vast area of Euro-Asia which is inaccessible to ships, but in antiquity lay open to the horse-riding nomads, as is to-day about to be covered with a network of railways?

## Zooming out

Though Mackinder's thesis is specific to 20th century Continental Europe, I think there is a broader framework at play. Personally, I read Mackinder as saying the following:

1. In the present day, there is a global hegemon. This hegemon is content, if haughty, with its place in the world. Modern history presented this hegemon with a task, a challenge, an "unclaimed space on which to plant its flags," and the hegemon did just that.

2. Well, not quite; there is still *some* space it failed to claim. And this particular space, as it goes, played host to singular and outsized destruction in the past. So, hegemon beware!

3. There is today a novel technology neatly poised to reify this destruction on a much grander scale than ever before.

With this framework in mind, what might Mackinder say if he were alive today?

## The United States

In the past 100 years, the United States has transformed itself from a non-interventionist island nation of lofty ideals into a heavyweight champion of military might, economic preponderance, and cultural dominance at global scale. To wit, 1918 saw President Woodrow Wilson delivering his [Fourteen Points](https://www.theworldwar.org/learn/peace/fourteen-points) touting "freedom of the seas and free trade and the concept of national self-determination," while 2020 America maintains ~1,000 [military bases](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-us-has-military-bases-in-172-countries-all-of-them-must-close/) in ~100 countries, controls ~30% of the [world's wealth](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-wealth-in-one-visualization/#:~:text=Leading%20the%20pack%20is%20the,share%20of%20the%20global%20total.), and cannot count on [seven sets of hands](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/23/the-cia-says-russia-hacked-the-u-s-election-here-are-6-things-to-learn-from-cold-war-attempts-to-change-regimes/) the number of times the CIA has [intervened in foreign countries](https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Hope-C-I-Interventions-II-Updated/dp/1567512526) since its [establishment in 1947](https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/history-of-the-cia). Though its detractors are harsh, and though President Donald Trump's foppishness and distinctly isolationist bent may indeed alter this course, the fact remains that the United States *is* Mackinder's unambiguous contemporary hegemon—his Continental Europe of 1904—comfortable, if [decaying](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/opinion/sunday/western-society-decadence.html), in its golden seat on the [58th floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower).

Europe achieved its own preponderance by winning the war of global *land*: occupying, with lust, zeal, and greed, as much of the map as it could. In turn, the United States reached its current seat by winning the war of global *ideas*, which Europe lost: from the brutal, hellish ruins of a 77-year battle royal from 1914 to 1991 between fascism, communism, and market-based democracy—in other words, not over who gets what of an empty map, but how we live where we currently are in a map already full—encompassing the two World Wars and the Cold War—the United States and the ideas it represented emerged victorious, while Continental Europe fell to ruin. In other words, the United States became the global imperial much like Columbian Europeans, patrolling the space of ideas with weapons and money instead of the seas themselves, and cementing its role as global hegemon in the process.

## The modern war of ideas

Whereas the 20th century fought over what I will call "macro-ideology"—how nation-states should self-organize in the broadest of terms—2020 America is home to vicious wars over, in comparison, "micro-ideology": conduct in the workplace, gender identity and bias, police brutality, racial justice, who "belongs" where, and a seeming infinity of other like topics that animate a sizable chunk of our current social discourse.

In this fight, people have taken to the street. To wit, the May 2020 murder of [George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd) at the hands of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin sparked humungous protests—mostly peaceful, with pockets of looting and outright violence on the part of the demonstrators and opposing police forces alike—around the country and world. In 2017, the day after Donald Trump's inauguration, the [Women's March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March) protesting his anti-women rhetoric became the largest single-day protest in U.S. history. Throughout the Trump presidency, white nationalists groups have variously assembled—the infamous Unite the Right 2017 rally in [Charlottesville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) as the most prominent example—declaiming in fire and fury, well, who really knows—to much public attention and even [counter-protest](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40980175).

Nevertheless, for all of the issues over which we currently fight, does it not feel like we fight the *majority* of these battles on our *screens* rather than in the streets themselves? Are the [Brownshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung) of our time not smashing the heads of their in the physical streets, instead patrolling the forums of Reddit and the "I don't know who needs to hear this; Thread 🧵:"'s of Twitter, throwing flame in the form of words at whoever disagrees? Has physical violence not largely been replaced by *reputational* violence, i.e. our modern [*cancel culture*](https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/cancel-culture/#:~:text=Cancel%20culture%20refers%20to%20the,the%20form%20of%20group%20shaming.)? For the *majority* of Americans, is the intensity of our political beliefs *really* commensurate with our corresponding actions in ["meatspace"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace)? Or do we say these things to our like-minded friends, feel these things when we come home from work, and then, out for blood and looking to fight, we take to the internet for twenty minutes to throw a few punches and be punched right back, then ice cream, Netflix, and early to bed?

Protest and demonstration in the streets is not dead. However, in terms of dynamism, impact, and sheer number of combatants, the internet truly is the modern battlefield.

## The remaining space on the map

As the dust settled over the world following, in effect, 75 brutal years of physical and ideological battle over macro-ideology, the United States emerged with a monopoly on economic, military and cultural capital. Today, it remains in this seat, much like Mackinder's Continental Europe at the conclusion of their own implicit victory—400 years of territorial and economic expansion unlike the world had ever seen. Nevertheless, in our modern day, there exists a new space on the map of human interaction that the United States has *not* conquered, the space where the modern war of ideology is largely waged, and, as it was ultimately the battle for ideology the felled the previous global rulers, a space of critical importance. This space, of course, is the internet—the Mackinderian Digital Heartland.

## The practical nature of battles online

Mackinder's dictum about the importance of the Central Asian heart-land stemmed from the impending technological revolution in its harmful potential: whereas the invaders used to crosse the steppe on camel and horse—slowly, in other words—they would soon be racing under starry desert skies on steam-powered train.

Presently, ideological battles online take place with text, video, and audio authored manually by humans; in other words, slowly! It is humans that write tweets and think-pieces to which other humans respond. It is humans that start digital media campaigns, create YouTube content, stoke the fires that lead to real-life protest and violence, and even coordinate large-scale protests themselves.

So, what happens when a technology comes along that stands to turbo-charge the speed and chaos with which these battles take place? What happens when the text, video and audio that comprise these battles are created not by humans, but by *algorithms*—unaccountable, indefatigable, at times sloppy, and brutally fast? Finally, what happens when human combatants, who we currently "eliminate" from battle via *reputational* assassination, are replaced by algorithms that are immune to our deadliest weapon?

## Mackinder on artifical intelligence

A 21st century Halford Mackinder would look at the deafening roll of artificial intelligence innovation in models that generate video, audio and language and be rightfully crapping his pants. Because simply, these models have the ability to online debate not what trains, but intercontinental ballistic missiles, would have done for the steppe invaders of centuries past.

To make this claim, we don't have to go much past the recent advent of [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/), neatly explained in the following video:

[![Click me!](http://img.youtube.com/vi/SboKeK6FFHQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SboKeK6FFHQ "GPT-3 - explained in layman terms.")

In essence, and borrowing from the video, "GPT-3 is an extremely sophisticated text predictor. A human gives it a chunk of text as input, and the model generates its best guess as to what the next chunk of text should be." In other words, and in terms of online battle, it reads what's written, and responds. However, crucially, whereas a human might reply to 1 or 2 posts over a 5-minute period, GPT-3 could reply to *thousands.*

And what happens when online battles proceed at warp speed? In a world whose news cycle already changes by the hour? In which social media is already such a dominant force?

Honestly, Mackinder's guess, and your guess, are as good as mine.

## Control of the Digital Heartland, and what's at stake
