Summary: I'm beginning to write about the intersection of artificial intelligence and geopolitics.
<!-- Image: images/asapp.jpg -->

Machine learning and artificial intelligence have long been passions; to date, I've spent many years—my entire professional career included—developing relevant expertise.

Separately, in recent years, I've been reading heavily in other areas: history, political theory, economics and geography; geopolitics, in sum. This has become a burgeoning passion as well.

Through reading, I've learned: the geopolitics of the past has its experts and central themes—collective security, nuclear armament, and oil, to name a few. Conversely, the geopolitics of tomorrow will take form from entirely new ideas; chief among them: artificial intelligence.

As such, I plan to merge the two: to suffuse, through writing, my exploration of the former with expertise in the latter. Specifically, through a thorough understanding of AI algorithms, and the likely implications of their widespread use, I aim to bring grounded insight re: the technical, economic and political risks and opportunities that AI may present to the geopolitics of tomorrow.

Finally, I aim to write objectively, i.e. devoid of political bias, about the issues that affect our world. Your comments—especially with respect to my evolving understanding of geopolitics itself—are encouraged as always.
