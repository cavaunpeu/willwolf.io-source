Summary: I'm beginning to write about the intersection of artificial intelligence and geopolitics.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence have long been passions; to date, I've spent many years—my entire professional career included—developing relevant expertise. This has been the historical focus of this blog.

In parallel, in recent years, I've been reading heavily in other areas: history, political theory, economics and geography; geopolitics, in sum. This has become a burgeoning passion as well.

The geopolitics of the past—the subject of my reading—has its experts and central themes: collective security, nuclear armament, and oil, to name a few. Conversely, the geopolitics of tomorrow will take form from entirely new ideas; chief among them: artificial intelligence.

As such, I plan to merge the two: to suffuse, through writing, my exploration of the former with expertise in the latter. Specifically, through a deep, technical understanding of AI algorithms, and the likely implications of their widespread use, I'll aim to bring grounded insight re: the technical, economic and political risks—and opportunities—that AI will present to the geopolitics of tomorrow.

My writing will be objective, i.e. devoid of overt political bias. Your comments—especially with respect to my evolving understanding of geopolitics itself—are encouraged as always.

Will
