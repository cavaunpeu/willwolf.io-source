As an "in" professional discipline, machine learning exhibits a curious behavior: though talent is frustratingly scarce, it's immensely *easy* for the individual to obtain. Why? **It's all available online, (largely) free for the taking.**

I did not get a bachelor's degree in this field (because one didn't exist at the time). Self-teaching at my kitchen table in 2014, I landed a job as a software developer which morphed into a data scientist role. Self-teaching still, I joined [ShopKeep](https://www.shopkeep.com/)'s data science team. Eighteen months later and wanting further technical expertise, I quit my job, left NYC, and jumped full-time into machine learning self-study — the best, if only, way I knew how.

In September of 2016, I moved to Casablanca, Morocco to pursue the ["Open-Source Machine Learning Masters"]({filename}/articles/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco.md) — a full-time, self-curated schedule of textbooks, MOOCs, publishing code to my [GitHub](https://github.com/cavaunpeu) and writing to this blog. Now back living and working in NYC, [decidedly successful]({filename}/articles/joining-asapp.md) in what I set out to do, I'd like to inform others as to how to  plan and execute a similar experience for yourself.

The following is a technical guide to the "Open-Source Machine Learning Masters" (OSMLM), covering the following topics.

1. Why this might be right for you
2. Building a curriculum
3. Logistics
    a. Educational resources
    b. Branding
    c. Workspace
    d. Where to live

5. A sense of urgency
6. Personal-development objectives, in parallel
7. Applying for the next job
8. Why there's very little risk
9. Why more people aren't doing this

## Why this might be right for you
You should pursue the OSMLM for the same reasons that you'd pursue a traditional Masters program: because you want further technical expertise in this field. The motivation behind this ambition may vary: perhaps you've a Bachelors in Economics, and want to break into data science; perhaps you're dexterous with scikit-learn, are effective in your role, but need to understand more deeply how your tools work in order to obtain a promotion; perhaps, you're deeply curious about kernel methods and feel it imperative to become an expert. The OSMLM, like a formal Masters, is a semi-broad deep-dive into select topics in the field.

The OSMLM confers a number of obvious benefits in cost, expediency, and flexibility. These are enumerated in detail in the [motivating post]({filename}/articles/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco.md). However, what are the downsides? To this effect, what type of person is required to pull this off?

### Downsides
1. **There is no one to push you but yourself.** A priori, there are no professors. There are no study groups. This is no tangible social pressure: it's probably just you.
2. **This might be viewed as a "radical" choice**. In ten years, I'm certain this will change. However, in 2018, you'll find few people with the line "open-source masters" on their résumé.
3. **The meritocracy comes to bear.** A Masters degree from a prominent University, along with a passable GPA, holds professional weight — for better or for worse. The OSMLM attacks on one main vector: talent is weight, and success in this program is developing this talent.

### Who this is for
Addressing the above in order, the OSMLM might be right for you if:

1. **You're convicted about your passion for the field**: the thought of studying machine learning all day has you smiling from ear to ear. No one will push you but yourself, and that's the only person you need.
2. **You don't mind being different.** You're not phased by the notion of explaining, crisply and with conviction, why you made the choice to pursue this program.
3. **You feel the meritocracy in your bones.** You're confident in your ability to master material, and communicate it back to others. You know what the bar is for employment in your desired role, you know that you'll surpass that bar after finishing this program, and you know that because *the meritocracy is real, this could do nothing but bear delicious, abundant fruit.*

## Building a curriculum
I know the landscape of machine learning educational resources exceedingly well, if only because the field is dear to me. I know what I know, and I know what textbooks, courses, dissertations and papers I'm dying to have the time and energy to properly consume.

For me, the OSMLM was 10 months of navigating, with discipline yet flexibility, this dreamscape.

Unfortunately, for you, prescribing an academic curriculum is outside the scope of this post for the following reasons:

1. Everyone will have a different base of knowledge when embarking on this program.
2. On some level, this should already be in motion: if "you’re convicted about your passion for the field" (as noted above), you probably already have some idea of what you'd like to learn.

This said, if you're looking for specific resources on specific topics, I likely *am* a great person with whom to speak, and I'm more than happy to help.

## Logistics

### Educational resources
Personally, I derived my educational resources from:
  - MOOCs (massive open online courses)
  - Textbooks (often obtainable in electronic format)
- Blog posts
- [mathematicalmonk videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA)
- [Udacity "Nanodegrees"](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Yours may be different. However, the promise is: **all of these materials are available online, and for a trivial or zero cost.**

### Branding
Again, this is a radical choice! If only because you won't know many others doing the same.

In NYC, everyone is asked for their story — in interviews, at parties, on the subway. Preparing to quit my job, leave the city and move to Morocco — what was mine? How would present this to others before leaving, during the experience, and after returning to the city? Believe it or not, I started thinking about this long before I ever left.

#### Before
Be excited. "Here's what I'm doing! Here's why I'm doing it! I'm scared, yet convicted. It's awesome, and I will be back, more learned than ever. Promise."

#### During
**Maintain a blog.** This is an extremely important point of strategy. **Arguably, this was my most crucial insight throughout this whole experience.**

Maintaining a blog serves three key ends:

1. **It helps you to concretize knowledge.** If you're going to share something with others, it is *easy* to motivate yourself to make sure you know what you're talking about. This stems from basic human tendency of fearing rejection, the perception of inconsistency, etc. A good blog post is one where you start with 70% of the knowledge required to share the material, and are forced to "cram" the remainder before publish.
2. **It helps you to stay relevant in other peoples eyes.** I was active about sharing my posts on Twitter and DataTau. Fortunately, they were shared by others. Further, I received 7 interview requests from managers that had read my blog, and continue to receive them to this day.
3. **It gives you something — everything — to talk about in your interviews upon your return.** I was keenly aware of the importance, for better or for worse, of maintaining a public sharing space of personal projects before I left for Morocco. Throughout the OSMLM, I could cynically be characterized as a "professional blog-writer/portfolio-builder". **Upon return, over half of my interviews began with: "Hey, I read that blog post which I really enjoyed. Mind walking me through it?" Uh, yep. No problem.**

In addition to a blog, I found that **maintaining a presence on Twitter proved valuable as well.**

1. **The machine learning community is small: build yourself a community within,** for all the same reasons that community-building is more generally valuable to your work, and quality of life.**
2. **People will likely find your idea enviable, and admirable.** Everyone likes a "radical", and the idea of living abroad for a year. In addition, if you're passionate about machine learning (and cognizant about the speed at which it moves), you probably relish the thought of full-time study as well.

### Workspace
I rented an apartment in Casablanca. However, I would not have been happy working out of that apartment as well.

For all those with ambition to work and travel: co-working spaces are a thing — even in Morocco. They have comparatively fast internet (to the median speed found in the city at large), desks, coffee, patios, food, and most importantly, other motivated individuals like yourself.

This is a personal choice. However, staying in my apartment all day would not have worked for me.

### Where to live
The world is huge! And in most of the world, $1,000/month gets you pretty far.

I chose to live in Morocco so as to improve my French, and live in an Arab country more generally. Your interests are probably different.

[NomadList](https://nomadlist.com/) is a terrific resource for choosing where to "digital nomad". It indexes countries based on things like:

- Cost of living
- Internet speed
- Weather
- Safety
- Female-friendliness
- LGBTQ-friendliness
- etc.

If you're unsure about where you might want to go, I would start here. **In addition, moving abroad is of course in no way a requirement for this program, whatsoever**. However, the assumption is that you won't be generating income, so doing this in your home country might prove expensive.

### Visas
Please, do not overlook visa requirements. Follow the rules. In Morocco, I was granted 3-month tourist visas, which I could renew by spending a few hours in neighboring Spain. For an in-depth look at visa regulations, please visit my personal favorite [VisaHQ](https://www.visahq.com/).

### Costs
Personally, my costs had the following dimensions:

- **Monthly rent: $600/month** for a beautiful, central, sunlit, and furnished 2-bedroom apartment in the center of Casablanca, which I often split with a friend.
- **Coworking space: $300/month**. Really expensive, in my opinion! (I found the same in Mexico City as well, that a monthly co-working fee ran roughly half of what I'd pay in rent.) All the same, **I only spent 2 months here before moving to friends' offices.**
- **Educational resources: roughly $1,100.** This said, I spent **\$800 on the first half of the [Udacity Artifical Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) program.** Thereafter, I bought a textbook, subscribed to some Coursera courses at \$50/per, etc. **If I wanted this cost to be \$0, I could have made that happen.** However, I do find these costs to be trivial for the value you receive in return. And more resolutely, as compared to tuition in a formal Masters setting.

In 10 months, I spent roughly $12,000. I ate out, traveled some, and overall afforded a terrific quality of life built around the thing I wanted to do most: full days of bright-eyed and well-rested machine learning study.

### Community
I knew 2 people in Casablanca before I left. Finding a community was important to me.

Technology/entrepreneurship communities can be found worldwide ([Adrian Avendano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianavendano/) is an unbelievable testament to this fact). Casablanca was no different. I attended Meetups, pitch events, happy hours, and even [PyData Casablanca](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Casablanca/)! After a while, I was able to surround myself with people that kept me happy and helped me grow. In addition, choosing to work from a co-working space can often give you this for free.

### Insurance
Like any extended international trip, ensure that you've premeditated your options in the event of theft, dental, or medical emergencies. This is standard practice.

For the OSMLM, give special thought to *computer* insurance as well: without it, there's not a whole lot of work that you can do.

If your computer breaks:
  - Where's the computer store?
  - How will i get a new one?
  - How long will this take?

This will vary by country. Investigate beforehand.

## Keeping a schedule
Like building a curriculum, this came easy to me: keeping a disciplined, focused schedule around machine-learning self-study was all I wanted to do.

If this comes less easily to you: **treat this like a job.** Get rest. Take weekends off. Exercise before you go to work (if that's your thing). Leave your workspace at a reasonable hour, and pursue hobbies, relationships and culture at night. Hold yourself accountable. Do whatever worked for you in a previous job, or period of your life.

## A sense of urgency
In a salaried job, you trade the potential myriad upside of entrepreneurship for stability: assuming you do your job well, you *will* receive a paycheck twice a month, (largely) irrespective of the hours you put in. "Hustling" bears few fruit. Ultimately, your goal is longevity: to continue to do great work, and be excited about this work; to not burn out; to be there in a few years' time.

In the OSMLM, things are different. Here, you've "ripped the carpet out from under you". You have no paycheck, no immediate professional support, no structural "crutch." Furthermore, once finished, you will have something to *prove* to your previous professional world (in interviews, etc.).

My [machine learning] goal for the OSMLM was to learn as much as possible. My resource-bottleneck was time. As such, it became *easy* to keep a robust schedule, and to work slightly-longer-than-normal hours. It was, stated *dramatically*, "fight or flight". Looking back, I am impressed, though not entirely surprised, with how much work I could produce in this context.

In the OSMLM, a sense of urgency *is a feature, not a bug.* Use it to your advantage — as a biologically-principled IV of raw motivation.

## Personal-development objectives, in parallel
- language
- working out
- you're in control of your days. if you only want to work 4, or until 3:22pm every day, or whatever, you can!
- the experience of living in a foreign country, and getting a fresh perspective on life. this isn't the place for me to extoll the benefits of travel, but yeah that's what we're talking about.

## Applying for the next job
- they loved me. and especially if you worked hard.
- have a narrative. clearly communicate why you wanted to do this, why it was the best choice, etc. it's a very easy case to make.
- remember: if you kept a blog, things will come to you!
- tech is very meritocratic. you'll be able to, concretely, show people your work
- if you've built a community of people that read your blog, you can simply post there, and people will share and read!

## Sincerely speaking, why there's really little risk
- assuming you actually put in the work
- if you fail, the field probably wasn't for you. i.e., if someone gave you months of an open-schedule to study ML, and you ended up not being very disciplined about crushing the field, then you probably don't really like it all that much
- worst case, you'll be a pseudo-expert in machine learning, perhaps with another language under your belt, ready to jump into this field for the first time, or back into it after a previous job

## conclusion
- you need a certain level of knowledge to be effective as a machine learning practitioner
- all of this knowledge is online
- to the extent that you're effective in teaching it to yourself -- and you sort of have to be in some way, because everyone that works in this field needs to kind of keep up, and therein lies self-teaching -- your biggest bottleneck resource is time, and energy
- a sabbatical reorg around these resources can allow you to pursue this expertise in an efficient, focused manner
- you'll come back with new expertise, new skills, new stories, and a unique path
- as i was told by a VP of Research during one of my interviews: "yeah, it's clear from your work that you learned far more in this year than you would have in a traditional masters"

*I literally do not know how else I could have acquired this knowledge.*

please let me know in comments how i can be of further help.

## Why I quit my job and pursued this program (deprecated)
Prior to the OSMLM, I worked as a Data Scientist at ShopKeep in NYC. I had a great job — fantastic technical colleagues, a competitive salary, and rewarding projects on which to grind my teeth. However, I knew that out there, in a field, lay a degree of technical expertise that I did not yet have, and, to the extent that I wanted to continue to progress as a technical contributor, one I'd soon need.

ShopKeep was not going to teach me how to do inference in probabilistic graphical models, nor the math behind recurrent neural nets. Wanting, and/or needing, to learn these things, I

 to roll an RNN by hand, nor the equivalences behind exponential-family GLMs and . If the project required it, sure, I'd be allotted the time to learn it myself. Notwithstanding, I entered my role with a certain level of ability, and progress thereafter, like in many jobs, was logarithmic: I first ramped up on my team's scientific and engineering stacks, covering new tools and algorithms along the way, then continued at a damp linear clip thereafter.

Ultimately, you're not paid a salary to learn, but instead to contribute economic value to the umbrella entity in one of myriad ways.

1. **I think the higher education paradigm is changing.** Access to critical, academic knowledge is increasingly democratic: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) can teach me about the Central Limit Theorem as well as any statistics professor. The ~$250,000 in tuition fees commanded by an undergraduate education at a private American university is, for some, several decades of debt and concession, and for others, prohibitive beyond comedy, reason and fantasy alike. If hard-skills are your end, online self-education is an immensely attractive, intuitive, and practical road to follow - especially in an industry as meritocratic as tech.
2. **I'm keenly aware of how productive I am in a self-teaching environment.** I'm largely self-taught in data science. Before that, it was online poker: a 5-year, $50 to $150,000 journey of instructional videos, online forums, critical discussion with other players and personal coaching - all from the comfort of my bedroom. I'm very effective at learning things online.
3. **Some of the most impactful projects I've completed professionally stemmed directly from those I'd completed personally.** I would not know how to ensemble models if not for [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I would not know how to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference if not for [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/). The open-source data science community continues to teach me creative ways to use data to solve challenging problems. To this end, I want to consume, consume, consume.
4. **The road to further technical expertise is a function of little more than time and effort.** I have a few years' industry experience as a Data Scientist. I can write clean code and productionize machine learning things. For me, the OSMLM is nothing more than taking all of the extra-curricular time spent learning new tools and algorithms and making it a full-time job.
5. **I'm extremely motivated.** The thought of studying machine learning all day has me smiling from ear to ear. Simply put, I f*cking love this stuff.
