As an "in" professional discipline, machine learning exhibits a curious behavior: though talent is frustratingly scarce, it's immensely *easy* for the individual to obtain. Why? **It's all available online, (largely) free for the taking.**

I did not get a bachelor's degree in this field (because one didn't exist at the time). Self-teaching at my kitchen table in 2014, I landed a job as a software developer which morphed into a data scientist role. Self-teaching still, I joined [ShopKeep](https://www.shopkeep.com/)'s data science team. Eighteen months later and wanting further technical expertise, I quit my job, left NYC, and jumped full-time into machine learning self-study — the best, if only, way I knew how.

In September of 2016, I moved to Casablanca, Morocco to pursue the ["Open-Source Machine Learning Masters"]({filename}/articles/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco.md) — a full-time, self-curated schedule of textbooks, MOOCs, publishing code to my [GitHub](https://github.com/cavaunpeu) and writing to this blog. Now back living and working in NYC, [decidedly successful]({filename}/articles/joining-asapp.md) in what I set out to do, I'd like to inform others as to how to  plan and execute a similar experience for yourself.

The following is a technical guide to the "Open-Source Machine Learning Masters" (OSMLM), covering the following topics.

1. Why this might be right for you
2. Building a curriculum
3. Logistics
    a. Educational resources
    b. Branding
    c. Workspace
    d. Visas
    e. Community
    f. Costs
    g. A sense of urgency
4. Keeping a schedule
5. Personal-development objectives, in parallel
6. Applying for the next job
7. Why there's very little risk
8. Why more people aren't doing this

## Why this might be right for you
You should pursue the OSMLM for the same reasons that you'd pursue a traditional Masters program: because you want further technical expertise in this field. The motivation behind this ambition may vary: perhaps you've a Bachelors in Economics, and want to break into data science; perhaps you're dexterous with scikit-learn, are effective in your role, but need to understand more deeply how your tools work in order to obtain a promotion; perhaps, you're deeply curious about kernel methods and feel it imperative to become an expert. The OSMLM, like a formal Masters, is a semi-broad deep-dive into select topics in the field.

The OSMLM confers a number of obvious benefits in cost, expediency, and flexibility. These are enumerated in detail in the [motivating post]({filename}/articles/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco.md). However, what are the downsides? To this effect, what type of person is required to pull this off?

### Downsides
1. **There is no one to push you but yourself.** A priori, there are no professors. There are no study groups. This is no tangible social pressure: it's probably just you.
2. **This might be viewed as a "radical" choice**. In ten years, I'm certain this will change. However, in 2018, you'll find few people with the line "open-source masters" on their résumé.
3. **The meritocracy comes to bear.** A Masters degree from a prominent University, along with a passable GPA, holds professional weight — for better or for worse. The OSMLM attacks on one main vector: talent is weight, and success in this program is developing this talent.

### Who this is for
Addressing the above in order, the OSMLM might be right for you if:

1. **You're convicted about your passion for the field**: the thought of studying machine learning all day has you smiling from ear to ear. No one will push you but yourself, and that's the only person you need.
2. **You don't mind being different.** You're not phased by the notion of explaining, crisply and with conviction, why you made the choice to pursue this program.
3. **You feel the meritocracy in your bones.** You're confident in your ability to master material, and communicate it back to others. You know what the bar is for employment in your desired role, you know that you'll surpass that bar after finishing this program, and you know that because *the meritocracy is real, this could do nothing but bear delicious, abundant fruit.*

## Building a curriculum

I know the landscape of machine learning educational resources exceedingly well, if only because the field is dear to me. I know what I know, and I know what textbooks, courses, dissertations and papers I'm dying to have the time and energy to properly consume.

For me, the OSMLM was 10 months of navigating, with discipline yet flexibility, this dreamscape.

Unfortunately, for you, prescribing an academic curriculum is outside the scope of this post for the following reasons:

1. Everyone will have a different base of knowledge when embarking on this program.
2. On some level, this should already be in motion: if "you’re convicted about your passion for the field" (as noted above), you probably already have some idea of what you'd like to learn.

This said, if you're looking for specific resources on specific topics, I likely *am* a great person with whom to speak, and I'm more than happy to help.

## Logistics

### Educational resources
Personally, I derived my educational resources from:
  - MOOCs (massive open online courses)
  - Textbooks (often obtainable in electronic format)
- Blog posts
- [mathematicalmonk videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA)
- [Udacity "Nanodegrees"](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Yours may be different. However, the promise is: **all of these materials are available online, and for a trivial or zero cost.**

### Branding
Again, this is a radical choice! If only because you won't know many others doing the same.

In NYC, everyone is asked for their story — in interviews, at parties, and on the subway alike. Getting ready to quit my job, leave the city and move to Morocco, what was mine? How I would present this to others in my life — before leaving, in Morocco, and upon return to the city? ...In fact, I started thinking about this well before I ever left.

#### Before
- here's what i'm doing! i'm convicted! it's awesome! i'll be back, better than ever. (nothing changes in your home city. promise. this is the second time i've done this)

#### During
- maintain a blog:
  - helps you to concretize knowledge
  - helps you to stay relevant in other people's eyes
  - gives you everything to discuss in interviews
  - project forward as to the types of work you'll want to show to others, i.e. the types of jobs which you'll want to pursue
  - do small projects that cover these areas, and write about them
- twitter
  - the machine learning o sphere is pretty small
  - for all the same reasons that community building can be valuable, build a community withinn this community
  - people will likely find your idea cool

### Workspace
- co working spaces are a thing!
  - note: they can be quite expensive -- like 1/2 of what your rent costs
- probably find one, and don't work out of your apartment
  - this is really a personal choice, but it wouldn't have worked for me

### Visas
- some countries are better suited for this than others
- https://nomadlist.com/
  - ranks cities based on:
    - cost of living
    - internet speed
    - weather
    - safety
    - female friendly
    - etc.

### Community
- find a local startup Community
  - there's likely one in whatever city you choose
  - meetups
- you'll sort've have this "digital nomad" vibe which, for better or for worse, is still relatively hip
- being in a coworking space, and one that hosts events, will give you this for free

## Building a curriculum
- here, i unfortunately have little advice.
- you could really do this program for 2 reasons:
  - you're just starting in the field
  - you've been in the field, and want to keep improving, or deep-diving on a few topics
- i know the landscape of this material really well, because it's really important to me
- i know what i don't know, and i know where to learn about the things i don't know, and who to learn them from
- this year for me was just navigating that subconscious ledger of courses, posts etc. that i dearly wanted to spend full days consuming prior to leaving

## Keeping a schedule
- treat it like a job
- take the weekends off!
- exercise in the morning
- leave at a reasonable hour, and perhaps do other things at night

## a sense of urgency
- leaving at 6pm or leaving at 9pm, and with a full time salary, well it doesn't make much of a difference
- here, you've "ripped the carpet out from under you"
- internalize this. know that your goal is to ultimately learn as much as possible, and expend your resources accordingly
- the most precious of these resources, as you've intrinsically already agreed, is time
- my point: it will become easy to spend your time well, to spend a lot of it, and to be focused

## costs
how much did i spend?!

## insurance
- this is mostly a travel thing
- however, since your computer is a crucial item for you, project ahead as to what would happen if it breaks
  - where's the computer store?
  - how will i get a new one?
  - how long will this take?

## Personal-development objectives, in parallel
- language
- working out
- you're in control of your days. if you only want to work 4, or until 3:22pm every day, or whatever, you can!
- the experience of living in a foreign country, and getting a fresh perspective on life. this isn't the place for me to extoll the benefits of travel, but yeah that's what we're talking about.

## Applying for the next job
- they loved me. and especially if you worked hard.
- have a narrative. clearly communicate why you wanted to do this, why it was the best choice, etc. it's a very easy case to make.
- remember: if you kept a blog, things will come to you!
- tech is very meritocratic. you'll be able to, concretely, show people your work
- if you've built a community of people that read your blog, you can simply post there, and people will share and read!

## Sincerely speaking, why there's really little risk
- assuming you actually put in the work
- if you fail, the field probably wasn't for you. i.e., if someone gave you months of an open-schedule to study ML, and you ended up not being very disciplined about crushing the field, then you probably don't really like it all that much
- worst case, you'll be a pseudo-expert in machine learning, perhaps with another language under your belt, ready to jump into this field for the first time, or back into it after a previous job

## conclusion
- you need a certain level of knowledge to be effective as a machine learning practitioner
- all of this knowledge is online
- to the extent that you're effective in teaching it to yourself -- and you sort of have to be in some way, because everyone that works in this field needs to kind of keep up, and therein lies self-teaching -- your biggest bottleneck resource is time, and energy
- a sabbatical reorg around these resources can allow you to pursue this expertise in an efficient, focused manner
- you'll come back with new expertise, new skills, new stories, and a unique path
- as i was told by a VP of Research during one of my interviews: "yeah, it's clear from your work that you learned far more in this year than you would have in a traditional masters"

*I literally do not know how else I could have acquired this knowledge.*

please let me know in comments how i can be of further help.

## Why I quit my job and pursued this program (deprecated)
Prior to the OSMLM, I worked as a Data Scientist at ShopKeep in NYC. I had a great job — fantastic technical colleagues, a competitive salary, and rewarding projects on which to grind my teeth. However, I knew that out there, in a field, lay a degree of technical expertise that I did not yet have, and, to the extent that I wanted to continue to progress as a technical contributor, one I'd soon need.

ShopKeep was not going to teach me how to do inference in probabilistic graphical models, nor the math behind recurrent neural nets. Wanting, and/or needing, to learn these things, I

 to roll an RNN by hand, nor the equivalences behind exponential-family GLMs and . If the project required it, sure, I'd be allotted the time to learn it myself. Notwithstanding, I entered my role with a certain level of ability, and progress thereafter, like in many jobs, was logarithmic: I first ramped up on my team's scientific and engineering stacks, covering new tools and algorithms along the way, then continued at a damp linear clip thereafter.

Ultimately, you're not paid a salary to learn, but instead to contribute economic value to the umbrella entity in one of myriad ways.

1. **I think the higher education paradigm is changing.** Access to critical, academic knowledge is increasingly democratic: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) can teach me about the Central Limit Theorem as well as any statistics professor. The ~$250,000 in tuition fees commanded by an undergraduate education at a private American university is, for some, several decades of debt and concession, and for others, prohibitive beyond comedy, reason and fantasy alike. If hard-skills are your end, online self-education is an immensely attractive, intuitive, and practical road to follow - especially in an industry as meritocratic as tech.
2. **I'm keenly aware of how productive I am in a self-teaching environment.** I'm largely self-taught in data science. Before that, it was online poker: a 5-year, $50 to $150,000 journey of instructional videos, online forums, critical discussion with other players and personal coaching - all from the comfort of my bedroom. I'm very effective at learning things online.
3. **Some of the most impactful projects I've completed professionally stemmed directly from those I'd completed personally.** I would not know how to ensemble models if not for [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I would not know how to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference if not for [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/). The open-source data science community continues to teach me creative ways to use data to solve challenging problems. To this end, I want to consume, consume, consume.
4. **The road to further technical expertise is a function of little more than time and effort.** I have a few years' industry experience as a Data Scientist. I can write clean code and productionize machine learning things. For me, the OSMLM is nothing more than taking all of the extra-curricular time spent learning new tools and algorithms and making it a full-time job.
5. **I'm extremely motivated.** The thought of studying machine learning all day has me smiling from ear to ear. Simply put, I f*cking love this stuff.
